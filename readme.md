# Reusable components

## What we will cover

* What is a reusable component?
* What is important to think about when you make one?

## Notes

What I am about to show you are two strategies I have found
to be useful for creating reusable components.

The big problem with a reusable component is that you often
find that you need to "tweak" it and this is where you as
the creator of the component need to define what is an
acceptable level of customisation.

The most common mistake I see is that you will try to create
a component that has too many configurations and you end up
with a super component that quickly becomes too complex to maintain.

In this video I will show you two different reusable components and
the mindset to have when you create each.
